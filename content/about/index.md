My name is Toma≈æ, I am also known online under my alias '**slax0r**', you can
find me on IRC network Freenode, or contact me on Twitter, handle **@slax0rr**.

I have been involved in software development for over 10 years, ranging from
system development to web development. In the past few years, I have switched my
focus primarily to web development. I like to think of myself as extremely
pedant and am a strong believer that code must be written beautifully.
