A new beginning. I have finally come around to updating my old website, and have
finally been able to try out [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a Static Site
Generator. If you haven't tried it out, and want to give it a Go(pun intended),
I strongly encourage you do to do so.

But enough about that. It's been a very long time since I've ran a blog, and the
last time I did, my laziness overpowered me, and I just stopped writing
articles. I can only hope that it will not be like this time, but I am making no
promises. ;)

I will try to write about my endeavours as a software developer, whenever I find
something interesting, figure out something new, think something might be
useful for other people, or something simply irritates me enough to go and write
about it. If you think you might find something interesting in the feature,
bookmark my site, or follow me on Twitter, I will be tweeting about every new
post in the future.
