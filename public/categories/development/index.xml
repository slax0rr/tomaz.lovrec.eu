      <description>I have just finished reading a slightly older Twitter thread involving storage of passwords in clear text format in the database by one of the largest mobile network company in Austria. This enraged me enough to go an write this blog post.
What bothers me more than practicing this, is the very apparent lack of sense of security by their employees, stating how their system is &amp;ldquo;amazingly good&amp;rdquo;, and that no one could breach their defenses.</description>
